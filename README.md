Theme: Social Impact
Problem Statement: Nowadays, it is commonplace to see children move away from home for work, education, etc. As this happens, on a large scale, we see
                    senior citizens, in their golden age, losing their sense of purpose and belonging. It is far too common for one to see many grandmas
                    and grandpas who grow bored and lonely, especially as socialization and making new friends becomes increasingly harder with age. To join social             groups and activities one was interested in, one would have to know somebody already engaged in those
          activities, or search online on haphazardly organised platforms (HARD for our non tech-savvy target audience!). As a result, many elders missed out
          on joining groups that would appreciate their participation, just because they didn't know about it. Unfortunately, we are leaving those who contributed
          their whole lives to society to be forgotten.
          
Solution: Our app takes basic info (name, age, M or F, etc), and the interests of a person (eg. Singing, Pottery). Then, using GPS, it
          captures an accurate location (which is set as "Home"), and suggests and connects them to activities (registered on the app) which adhere to their     interests! Users can create their own events, suggest gatherings, drastically improving the network of community events they can engage with.
        Our app isn't just limited to the senior age group: We truly believe that the creation and expansion of positive communities will have a great
        impact on the general well being of many; especially those suffering with issues such as social anxiety. By connecting people, we are creating
        an ecosystem of engagement, such that we help many rediscover their sense of purpose.



# NPSKhack-RNR_1
Welcome to NPSk-hack 2023! This is your official github repository. We will track your submissions via this repository. Your team can use this repository as a general version control system, but we need at least one push hourly to prevent any plagiarism. Your final submission code should be uploaded in this repository by the end of day 1 without fail.

We hope everyone has git installed in their systems. Here are some basic git bash commands you may need.

(Open the git bash in your system to use these commands)-

**git init** 

**git add .** (the '.' is used for adding all untracked/new files)

**git commit -m "<message>"**

**git branch -M main** #(to move to the main branch just incase you aren't)

**git remote add origin https://github.com/npskrmhack/NPSKhack-RNR_1.git**

**git push -u -f origin main** #(the -u switch makes the remote GitHub repo the default for your existing project. The -f switch forces Git to overwrite any files that already exist on GitHub with your existing projectâ€™s files)

If you have any git doubts feel free to search the same online or inform your volunteer.

All the best! Happy coding!
